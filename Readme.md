# Font Zoom

A Wordpress plugin which gives the ability to zoom in/out on various text elements (think user readability enhancement). After a user edits their zoom level the plugin sets a cookie so that it will remember their setting and use it.

## Example

## Installation (not necessarily in order)

Step One: Simply apply the CSS class "larger" to whatever text element that should have the ability to be resized (NOTE: this is best implemented on a responsive design, for obvious reasons).

Step Two: Add in the "buttons" which will trigger the font re-size. These buttons should have the classes of...

Zoom In Button = "zoomIn"
Zoom Out Button = "zoomOut"

Step Three: Install the WP plugin and activate it.

Step Four: Wow your users with text that is easily read, no matter how bad their eyesight! ;)
